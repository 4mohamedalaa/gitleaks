            Gitleaks has detected potential secrets in the codebase.
            
            **Details:**
            - Commit: ${context.sha}
            - Branch: ${context.ref}
            - Workflow run: ${process.env.GITHUB_SERVER_URL}/${context.repo.owner}/${context.repo.repo}/actions/runs/${context.runId}
            
            ### Next Steps:
            1. Review the scan results in the Actions tab
            2. Remove any detected secrets
            3. Rotate any exposed credentials
            4. Update any affected systems
            
            â›” **IMPORTANT**: The pipeline will continue to fail until all detected secrets are removed.
            
            Please handle this with urgency to maintain security.`;
